title: Define your first event handler

Nuxt has built-in support to create server endpoints. You can use it to fetch your data from your database, request other API, return static content, think like express.js with super powers, thanks to [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) and [UnJS](https://unjs.io/) ecosystem.

This is a basic example of directory structure for your `<app>/server/` directory:

:::code-group
```bash [Terminal] 
├── <app>/
│   ├── server/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   │   └── hello.ts # /api/hello
│   │   ├── routes/
│   │   │   └── sitemap.xml.ts # /sitemap.xml
│   │   ├── plugins/ # nitro plugins
│   │   ├── tasks/ # nitro tasks
│   │   ├── middleware/ # nitro middlewares
│   │   └── utils/ # server only utils
```

:doc-heading{label="Hello world route" .mb-4}

We will create a `/api/hello` route that will return a greeting message.

::code-group
```ts [<app>/server/api/hello.ts]
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // extract the "from" query parameter
  const from = getQuery(event)?.from || 'tairo'

  return `Hello ${from}!`
})
```
::

You can test your API route by visiting `http://localhost:3000/api/hello?from=world` in your browser or by using `curl`:

::code-group
```bash [Terminal]
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/hello?from=world
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
# content-type: text/html
# date: Wed, 19 Apr 2023 18:03:31 GMT
# connection: close
# content-length: 12
#
# Hello world!
```
::


:doc-heading{label="Dynamic routes" .mb-4}

You can also define dynamic routes by using the `[paramName]` syntax in either files or directories. For example, if you want to create a route that will have a dynamic `id` parameter, you can create a file named `<app>/server/api/product/[id].ts` or a directory named `[id]` like `<app>/server/api/product/[id]/index.ts`.

In addition to parameters, you can add suffixes to your dynamic routes. For example, you can create a route that will only accept `POST` requests by creating a file ending with `.post.ts`.


::code-group
```ts [<app>/server/api/add-to-cart/(id).post.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(await (event) => {
  // get the id parameters from the context
  const id = getRouterParam(event, 'id')

  // read and parse the request body
  const body = await readBody(event)

  // add the product to the cart (this is just an example)
  const cartItem = await addToCart(id, body.quantity)

  // perform other actions ...

  // returning an object will automatically set 
  // the content-type: application/json header
  return cartItem
})
```

title: Connect your data
code: false

Now that you have a page and an API route, you can connect them together. We will request the hello API route from the page created [in the previous section](/documentation/setup/first-page) and display the result.

::code-group
```vue [<app>/pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
// definePageMeta ...

// create a reactive input value
const input = ref('')

// create a computed object that will be updated
// every time the input value changes
const query = computed(() => ({ from: input.value }))

// call our API route, it will be re-fetched
// every time the query object changes
// note that data type is detected automatically!
const { data } = useFetch('/api/hello', {
  query,
})
</script>

<template>
  <div class="max-w-lg">
    <BaseCard class="p-6">
      <!-- reactive input -->
      <BaseInput 
        label="Your name" 
        v-model="input"
      />

      <!-- display the result -->
      <BaseParagraph class="mt-4 line-clamp-1 max-w-sm">
        {{ data }}
      </BaseParagraph>
    </BaseCard>
  </div>
</template>
```
::

We've seen that using the :doc-linker{to="BaseInput"}, :doc-linker{to="BaseCard"} and :doc-linker{to="BaseParagraph"} components was very easy. You may also want to take a look at how we do [form validation](/documentation/guides/form-validation) and explore form pages from the demo to learn more about how to build forms with Tairo.
