The **recommended way** to start a new project with Tairo. 

:::doc-message{color="muted-contrast" icon="ph:info"}
This step requires you to have unlocked your [github access](https://cssninja.io/faq/github-access) and have a [github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with the `repo` scope for classic token, or read access to the Tairo repository for fine-grained access token.

  #description
  Link your project to the Tairo layers by adding them to the `nuxt.config.ts` file. The version `__TAIRO_LAYERS_VERSION__` is the latest stable version of Tairo, you can also use the `edge` version which contains the current development version (useful for testing new features).

:icon{name="ph:warning"} If you forgot to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, if your token does not allow access to Tairo repository, or if you set a non existing version, you will see an error message like this:

 ERROR  Failed to download https://api.github.com/repos/cssninjaStudio/tairo/tarball/v1.5.0: 404 Not Found

This is the quickest way to start a project with Tairo when you want to use the source code directly.
It's also the way to go if you want to **run the demo app**.

::doc-component-demo
---
title: Demo app overview
---
The demo app is a separate app layer. It's a good starting point to see how Tairo is used to build a dashboard application.


:doc-heading{label="Demo project structure" .mb-4}

The Tairo demo is split into different nuxt layers. This allow to separate the marketing part from the documentation part, and to enable or disable features easily. 

:::code-group
```bash [Terminal]
├── .demo/ # This is the entry point of the demo (demo app layer)
├── layers/
│   ├── documentation/ # Contains nuxt/content related features
│   └── landing/ # Contains marketing related features
```
:::


By default, documentation layer is disabled.  
You can set the `ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION=true` environment variable in the `.demo/.env` file to enable it before starting the demo server. This will  generate the components documentation from the source code (via [nuxt-component-meta](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/nuxt-component-meta)). Note that this feature is heavy, requires more memory and can slow down the development server.


:doc-heading{label="Start the demo development server" .mb-4}

To start the project from the `.demo/` instead of the `<app>/` folder, run this command:

:::code-group
```bash [Terminal]
pnpm --filter=demo dev
```
:::

:::doc-message{color="muted-contrast" icon="lucide:info"}
Don't forget to update the `tsconfig.json` to extend the `.demo` folder.
