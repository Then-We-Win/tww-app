title: What is Nuxt?
---

Nuxt is a full-stack framework that combines Vue and Nitro to create universal applications.

With a few settings, you can swap from a full SSR application to a static application, or even a combination of both. Create full server applications as a replacement of `express` or `koa` for instance, or create a full stack application with a single framework, including fully typed code, optimized payload, and more.

It also has out-of-the-box support for a high number of pre configured providers, including Edge Worker, such as [Cloudflare Workers](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/cloudflare), [Vercel](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel), [Netlify](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/netlify), [Firebase](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/firebase), and more.

title: What is a Nuxt Layer?
---
A Nuxt application can grow very fast. You can be multiple developers working on the same application, or you can have multiple applications that share common features.

Layers is a mechanism that allows you to split your application into multiple directories, each with their own `nuxt.config.js` file. Each directory can be a full Nuxt application, with its own `pages`, `components`, `plugins`, and more. 

At the end, all layers are merged together, representing a single application.

In order to keep your application maintainable, you need to organize your code. We help you do that with Nuxt Layers. The code in Tairo does not interfere with your own code, has minimal dependencies, and all features are optional, meaning they won't be loaded if you don't actually use them.

You can also override any component, by creating a component with the same name in your application. This allows you to customize Tairo to your needs, without having to rewrite all the code.

title: How Tairo uses Nuxt Layers
---
Tairo is a set of Nuxt layers that you can enable depending on your needs. 

This creates a Nuxt application that contains only what's actually used. Keep only the layers you need, and remove the ones you don't, so that your application is as light as possible. 

It also a great and efficient way for us to provide you with more features and updates, without taking the risk to break your application!
