Tairo is a premium template sold on [ThemeForest](https://go.cssninja.io/buy-tairo). You have to purchase a license to get access to the source.

Once you own a license, you will be able to download the source from your ThemeForest account. You can also get your [github lifetime access](https://cssninja.io/faq/github-access) from us, which will allow you to get the latest updates, before they're even released on ThemeForest.

title: Get help from our support team
---
When purchasing a license, you get access to our [integrated support portal](https://cssninja.io/faq/support) up to six months after your order. You can ask questions, send your feedback, report bugs and get help from our support team.

Please read the [troubleshooting guide](/documentation/guides/troubleshooting) before asking for help, as it may help you solve your issue faster.

Once your support period is over, we still give you the opportunity to ask questions on our support portal, but we cannot guarantee a response.

In any case, we encourage you to join us on our [discord server](https://go.cssninja/discord), where you can find previous answers to common questions and get help from the community. Feel free to share your feedback, ideas and promote your projects!

The template is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You need to have [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. *We do not recommend using the latest version of Node.js as they might introduce breaking changes and produce unexpected results with underlying dependencies.*
