The `BaseProse` component is an implementation of the Tailwind CSS typography plugin, made ready to use for your content driven pages. It is a wrapper component that applies the default styles to the content inside it. It inherits the `muted` color set in `<app>/app.config.ts`. It is also possible to use the `BaseProse` component as a base for your own custom components.
