          Tairo is built on top on the Nuxt Layers concept. Layers can be seen
          as groups of components and composables that are related to each
          other. They help create a consistent experience and a maintainable
          codebase.

          Tairo ships with a lot of UI components, from the smallest parts
          required to build a web application to more complex organisms with
          their own logic.
