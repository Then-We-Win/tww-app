# App Extensions

The Experience Engine offers "App Extensions" for the most common types of User Interfaces your app may need.

The general idea behind an App Extension is that you can include it into your app, and it will provide you with (hopefully) everything you could ever need to enable that functionality within your application.

For example, if you need to add chat to your app, adding our Chat Extension should give you everything you may ever need out of the box, with only configuration left to provide.

Because these extensions are advanced (much more advanced than NPM or other classic package manager can provide), and will need to inject parts of code into multiple locations within your application, they can only be used with equally advanced UI frameworks.

# Vue.js / Quasar Only
